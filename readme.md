[MASTERMIND](https://adevlinb.github.io/Mastermind/) is traditionally a  two-player game from the 1970's that is an off-shoot of the original pencil and paper based game called **"Cows and Bulls"** The modern version uses a playing board and colored pegs for the player to attempt a code with grayscale pegs for the code setter to respond with feedback.

### **TECHNOLOGIES** 
**HTML**, **CSS**, **JAVASCRIPT**, and **AFFINITY DESIGNER** were all used to create this computer based version of the game where color represents the code, just like the board game. While HTML, CSS, and Javascript were the core technologies to make it possible to access user input, respond accordingly, and have elements displayed on the web page, I brought in affinity designer to manipulate some of the background images to get the textures I was looking for. Special thanks to **GitHub** and **GH-Pages** for hosting my code and gaming website.

1. Choose 4 digit color code to be guessed
2. Submit Guess
3. Computer compares user code to computer
4. responds with black / grey pegs to represent correct colors / positions
4. Player takes another guess until:
5. Player guesses correctly: WIN! or
6. Countdown to LOSE.. 10 guesses total
7. Number of guesses/saves/loses recorded
8. After win: play again? (Button appears) or reset scores?

### ICEBOX:

Down the road I would consider other fesature sets that would be a nice addition:
1. Difficulty Level Choice
    - change in number of guesses
    - change in number of codes beyond 4
2. Multi-Player
    - connection over internet to play against a friend. One person as the code setter / feedback giver, and the other as the guesser!
